This app is a simple hangman style word guess game that was developed for a space summer camp. The main goal of the game is to allow kids to guess words based off of topics they learned throughout the camp!

How the App was Created

It was created using simple HTML and CSS, combined with javascript and Jquery. The basic logic is a small pre set word bank which holds all possible words. One is randomly selected and presented to the player. Upon each keystroke guess the random chosen word is looped through and searched to see if the guessed letter is there. If it is, the letter is then properly displayed. The user has a limited ammount of guesses before they either win or lose the game, at which point it resets.
